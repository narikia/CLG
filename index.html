        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <h3>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</h3>
        <p>A markup language adds tags to a plain text document to define the structure and behaviour of the text.</p>
        <p>Hypertext refers to the hyperlinks that link pages together to create a website or link to external pages/content.</p>
        <p>Elements consist of an opening tag, the content and a closing tag.</p>
        <p>Examples of an element is headings, a paragraph, an image or a link.</p>
        <p>Elements can contain attributes within quoatation marks, such as a link to a domain, page or image.</p>
        <h2>Coding a Web Page</h2>
        <p>!DOCTYPE html is the first line of code required in every web page. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is processed the same way by different web browsers.</p>
        <p>In older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration is more complicated because the declaration must refer to a DTD (Document Type Definition).</p>
        <p>After the Doctype declaration follows a html element, which is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.</p>
        <p>The head element gives information to the browser about the page that is not directly displayed (metadata). Metadata typically defines the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.</p>
        <p>The body element is the main content of the page that is displayed by the browser.</p>
        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <h3>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <p>With CSS you can customise how each HTML element appears; how elements are positioned and laid out. This covers text color, text style, sizes of elements, how images are displayed on the page, and so much more.</p>
        <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
        <ul><li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li></ul>
        <p>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp" target="_blank">Learn more about CSS at w3schools here.</a></p>
